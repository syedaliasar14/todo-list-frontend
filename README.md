### Notes

- The MySQL database is hosted on the cloud by Aiven so dev and prod use the same database for this project.
- The frontend is hosted via **Vercel** and the backend is hosted via **Render**; it may take a minute for the data to load the first time you visit the prod application.
- For security reasons, please refer to my email to retrieve the value for ```DATABASE_URL``` environment variable.
